## VirtualTitrationParts

The following repository contains the 3D models for constructing the burette for a virtual titration experiment.

Potentiometer parts can be found here: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZKK6T8S/?coliid=IGFDEJ5SO1UKK&colid=1AADUAQOWXS1H&ref_=list_c_wl_lv_cv_lig_dp_it&th=1

Remainder of the electronic parts and setup can be found in the: Virtual Titration SetUp pdf


Software for the virtual titration experiment can be found here: https://github.com/fwliu1/VirtualTitrationBuild


Credit: These experiences were designed by Charles Amador and Frank Liu at the Meteor Studio. Highschoolers at Lumos Art Academy helped redesign the burette base.
